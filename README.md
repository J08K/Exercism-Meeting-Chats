# Exercism-Meeting-Chats

 The chats of the meetings which are held every week. This repository contains the chats of the meetings we had since April 30th of 2020. It is coded in python 3.8.1. Probably noone asked for this, but it's here anyway and I'll try to keep it updated!

 If you want to view the chats, just go to _Meetings\converted_.

 To convert the chat of a meeting into a _.md_ file, you'll have to copy all the messages, just by pressing _ctrl+a_ and _ctrl+c_, then paste it into a _.txt_ file encoded using the _utf-8_ standard. Then run the tool in that directory by using `python exercism-meetings.py --input .txtfile --output .mdfile --date dateOfMeeting`. You can also just run the _.exe_ file in the _bin_ directory of the _tool_ folder.

 If you have any suggestions or if you want to add your own code, then feel free to do so! You can also add your own _.md_ file from meeting if I missed the meeting.

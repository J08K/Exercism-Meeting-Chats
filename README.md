# Exercism-Meeting-Chats

 The chats of the meetings which are held every week. This repository contains the chats of the meetings we had since April 30th of 2020. It is coded in python 3.8.1. Probably noone asked for this, but it's here anyway and I'll try to keep it updated!

 If you want to view the chats, just go to _Meetings\converted_.

 To convert the chat of a meeting into a _.md_ file, you'll have to copy all the messages, just by pressing _ctrl+a_ and _ctrl+c_, then paste it into a _.txt_ file encoded using the _utf-8_ standard. Then run the tool in that directory by using `python exercism-meetings.py --input .txtfile --output .mdfile --date dateOfMeeting`. If you want to change the "Me" username in the chat, you can add `--name NewUsername` to your command. You can also just run the _.exe_ file in the _bin_ directory of the _tool_ folder using a terminal.

 If you have any suggestions or if you want to add your own code, then feel free to do so! You can also add your own _.md_ file from meeting if I missed the meeting. Just create a _pull request_.

 Yes, I am planning to add a _index.html_ file for _Github Pages_, but I am not experienced in _web development_, so that will take a while. If you are experienced in _web development_ and you want to help out, please create a pull request and we'll discuss it from there on.

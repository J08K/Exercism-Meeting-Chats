@DJ: no, it allows keys too, it's not a boolean

No. It allows you to say it's optional based on this property

what about the idea of "exercise owners" that you mentioned you and Erik discussed before?

D
19:56

Ah yes

S
19:57
 
to Everyone
It's never obviously in or out of scope

D
19:57
 
to Everyone
Obviously

R
19:58
 
to Everyone
Would it be easier to have a permanently open issue for each exercise in each track and the "owner" is assigned to it? Any user issues raised about it can be mentioned/linked to in the thread so they can action it. And reassignment in case of drop out (or incompetence) can be done easily.

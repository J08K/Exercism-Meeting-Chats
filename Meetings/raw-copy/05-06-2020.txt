Wow @KOTP is that you playing?




19:00

Erik (@erikschierboom)

Haircut looks good DJ!




19:00

DJ (SleeplessByte)

thanks haha




19:00

DJ (SleeplessByte)

Not wearing a cap, I know




19:01

KOTP

That was not me playing, unless you count a recorder a musical instrument.

Gabriel Nelle (tehsphinx)

Hey everyone!




19:01

DJ (SleeplessByte)

It's like me cooking today: "I pressed order now"




19:01

KOTP

Wait, that is a musical instrument.  Stupid words that are the same but mean different things.




19:01

Erik (@erikschierboom)

:D




19:02

KOTP

Where did JW go?  We could still be enjoying the overture as we wait for the real show!




19:02

DJ (SleeplessByte)

Normally i'd speak about something stupid but still working so someone else say something :P

Still working on fixing the chat transcription, but the my old method still works




19:04

me and Bethany found a new method last week




19:04

Erik (@erikschierboom)

Sorry about last week's format Job!




19:05

Me

No dont worry, apperantly the chat is formatted differently between the desktop client and the Web client




19:05

Erik (@erikschierboom)

Okay. I quite like the web client :)

3=300




19:17

DJ (SleeplessByte)

i think when I checked last, I had ~498 unique solutions in the first 500, AFTER removing whitespace




19:17

DJ (SleeplessByte)

(for bob)




19:23

DJ (SleeplessByte)

(quick question: what's the goal/point of grouping? what are we talking about/solving??)




19:23

KOTP

Being able to show different approaches for the student.




19:23

KOTP

(No need to show identical solutions).




19:23

DJ (SleeplessByte)

Automated?




19:23

DJ (SleeplessByte)

Ahhh




19:23

DJ (SleeplessByte)

Got it. Okay thanks <3




19:24

KOTP

Currently browsing other solutions is hit or miss for interesting solutions, and kind of a waste of time for every one you click on that is identical to your own solution.




19:25

Gabriel Nelle (tehsphinx)

So... we'd also need to auto-categorize every new solution?




19:27

Tim (neenjaw) (chat only)

+1 KOTP, very hard to find solutions




19:28

DJ (SleeplessByte)

I think what's most important is that this does NOT need to be perfect at all




19:28

Tim (neenjaw) (chat only)

AST > tag features / patterns to general tags > group solutions by tags




19:28

DJ (SleeplessByte)

We just can start with one tag, and not tag it if you can't find that.




19:28

DJ (SleeplessByte)

Yes, exactly




19:28

DJ (SleeplessByte)

tagger




19:28

Tim (neenjaw) (chat only)

automated-tagging




19:30

DJ (SleeplessByte)

my recommendation would be:

extract utility functions, but not rules, because rules need context




19:31

DJ (SleeplessByte)

(and the better the context, the better the comment, but that means you'll find it will be hard to do fine-grained context with a broad-based rule)




19:31

Erik (@erikschierboom)

This! ☝️




19:34

Me

Im going to eat off camera real quick... I'll still be listening




19:34

DJ (SleeplessByte)

You can eat on camera like I usually do and make everyone either hungry or angry :P 




19:34

DJ (SleeplessByte)

(enjoy the food!)




19:34

Taiyab Raja

Mukbang!




19:35

Me

Hahah I could do that, but I'll keep my pizza to myself :)




19:35

Me

Haha thanks though




19:35

DJ (SleeplessByte)

So two tiers :)




19:35

DJ (SleeplessByte)

I like that too




19:35

Erik (@erikschierboom)

Ooh, I had pizza too 🍕




19:36

Me

Lovely!




19:36

Tim (neenjaw) (chat only)

I am not a really experienced in ML, but could this at somepoint be a semi-supervised training model? Mentors tag some solutions, then the model co...




19:36

Gabriel Nelle (tehsphinx)

Yeah, I think that could work, yes.




19:37

DJ (SleeplessByte)

Yes I agree




19:37

Gabriel Nelle (tehsphinx)

Especially since it doesn't hurt to be wrong




19:37

DJ (SleeplessByte)

We actually looked at this in our company when building the first analyzer




19:37

DJ (SleeplessByte)

One person came up with having ML define a context-language/grammar for the solution and go from there. POC worked pretty well




19:39

Tim (neenjaw) (chat only)

then can have on auto-tagged solutions "this tag was auto-generated, if it's wrong, tell us!" harness people to provide feedback to the model




19:39

DJ (SleeplessByte)

Yes!




19:40

Tim (neenjaw) (chat only)

gives us the ability to have incorrect tags, but hopefully better tags over time




19:40

Erik (@erikschierboom)

Indeed




19:40

Tim (neenjaw) (chat only)

But if the tags are just for approaches, and not for feedback, does it need to be near-100%?




19:44

Taiyab Raja

@DJ Can you link it?




19:44

KOTP

Agree or not, we are thinkingers, it is what we get paid for.

Angelika Tyborska

I was always tempted to write a blog post about some Exercism exercise, but I always thought it's a bad idea because it would give people spoilers for exercises they are not suppoesd to be looking at before attempting to solve them themselves.




19:46

Taiyab Raja

Thanks




19:46

DJ (SleeplessByte)

@angelika I totally get that, but I think you'll be fine by putting a disclaimer at the top to go do the exercise first :)




19:46

DJ (SleeplessByte)

It's up to people to decide if they want to actively learn or be passive about it.




19:46

KOTP

Warnin people at the top of the blog post, they have access to the source code and solutions anyway, if they are looking for them.




19:46

KOTP

They can be responsible and restrict themselves from reading a solution.




19:48

KOTP

Having the solution and reading about the background thought process for that solution is a great thing.




19:48

Erik (@erikschierboom)

> they have access to the source code and solutions anyway, if they are looking for them.

I've seen solutions where I'm fairly sure people have found the example solutions somewhere. I don't mind that personally. If people just want to solve something and learning things is less of a goal, they are happy to. People that do want to learn things will try to do things themselves first I feel. That's at least how I personally do things




19:49

DJ (SleeplessByte)

Same. You want to cheat? Sure. You don't learn from that.




19:49

Erik (@erikschierboom)

Yep. Your choice, not _my_ problem :)




19:49

KOTP

And learning is not cheating.  There is no "cheat" on Exercism.  There is learn or don't learn.




19:49

DJ (SleeplessByte)

Exactly! x2




19:49

Tim (neenjaw) (chat only)

^ +1




19:51

KOTP

(Otherwise we might think that mentor notes is "cheating" in the other direction.)




19:55

Erik (@erikschierboom)

Reminder: 5 minutes left ⌛ :)




19:58

DJ (SleeplessByte)

I don;t think it's 3 approaches, I think it's "tierd"




20:04

DJ (SleeplessByte)

What I like about classifiers is that you can build them post launch




20:04

DJ (SleeplessByte)

analyzers are EASIER to build when you have a lot of solved solutions




20:05

DJ (SleeplessByte)

so tiers




20:06

DJ (SleeplessByte)

(so for those whomstve don't know: it's already detached via website-copy, but I MUST write the first iteration)




20:06

DJ (SleeplessByte)

(and it's coupled)




20:06

Yasin

is there any thoughts about i18n? (exercism in other languages)




20:07

Tim (neenjaw) (chat only)

I think there is perhaps more personal merit to article-format.  As DJ saw with being able to repost his analyzer article to different platforms




20:07

DJ (SleeplessByte)

yep




20:08

DJ (SleeplessByte)

5, but I won't be translating ha




20:09

DJ (SleeplessByte)

google translate commentary (and skip code tags) would be cool too ahha




20:09

KOTP

You could translate whomstve for me though.




20:09

Angelika Tyborska

Google translate to Polish on technical texts would produce gibberish




20:10

DJ (SleeplessByte)

whomstve = who + whom + whose.

I usually correct people whomstve say "who" when they meant whom, but it used to annoy them, so I would now say whomstve so people think about it themselves :P




20:10

Gabriel Nelle (tehsphinx)

In our company KB we just fall back to English if a translation does not exist (on per article basis)




20:10

DJ (SleeplessByte)

yeh, that's cool too




20:10

Taiyab Raja

Google Translate automatically tries to do that when browsing non-native language websites in Chrome.




20:10

DJ (SleeplessByte)

I think we do the same!




20:10

Taiyab Raja

So why do it on the website?




20:10

DJ (SleeplessByte)

That's true too




20:12

Me

Two weeks or so and I'll have vacation which means stress from school is gone and I can focus on Exercism




20:12

Erik (@erikschierboom)

⌛⌛




20:12

Taiyab Raja

Nice Job




20:13

Me

Haha thank you!




20:13

Giorgio

translated.net provide machine learning translation




20:13

Angelika Tyborska

I am really worried that having Exercism in natural language X will make students expect to also receive mentoring in natural language X




20:13

Erik (@erikschierboom)

Excellent point




20:13

Taiyab Raja

That's a good point Angelika




20:13

Giorgio

Good point




20:14

DJ (SleeplessByte)

⌛⌛⌛⌛⌛⌛⌛⌛ (thank you Erik :D )




20:14

Yasin

I believe It is not needed to have a translator and wait them to finish all. I think this should be like a progress and it is needed to be a "probable" site. You can put this as a "plugin" and whenever someone translate (or osme group verify etc) the least piece (like one exercise), then it can be open/published




20:16

Gabriel Nelle (tehsphinx)

I have seem "chats" where everything gets automatically translated to your language and you can always look at the original per chat message. Maybe we are at the point where autom. translation is good enough for mentoring.




20:17

Me

Im going to be working on a method so that everyone can get the chat and format it. Suggestions of features are welcome.

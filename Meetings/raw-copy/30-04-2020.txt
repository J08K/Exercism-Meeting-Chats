Anyone else excited for a longer weekend? (in countries that celebrate a bank holiday tomorrow) 😃




19:01

Erik (ErikSchierboom)

No bank holiday in the Netherlands, but May 5th is Liberation Day (WW2), so it _is_ a long weekend :)




19:01

Me

yeahh




19:01

Sascha

You just had King's Day too, didn't you?




19:01

Me

yup we did 




19:01

Me

still have a mini dutch flag besides me




19:02

Erik (ErikSchierboom)

Jep

pvcarrera (Pablo Vicente)

In Spain we are still on lock down so we don't have to work but we have to stay at home :)




19:04

KOTP (Vic)

Holidays have been cancelled until further notice.




19:04

Erik (ErikSchierboom)

I imagine having to stay at home is hard




19:04

Me

oh, well we have are in the middle of an "intelligent lockdown"




19:04

zuzia-kru

Yep, I'm in Spain but still excited to not work

lol I can't see or hear anyone but glad I came for the chat :)




19:21

Erik (ErikSchierboom)

lol!

DJ (SleeplessByte)

📜 For Bobby: Jeremy is talking about an Exercism Bot to help us out remove some personal feeling when someone's PR doesn't align with the things we need at Exercism at the moment.




19:22

Corey (cmccandless)

Another benefit of that "cookie-cutter" feedback coming from a clearly automated source: it strips that "personal attack" feel from the feedback so the contributor is less likely to be put off in receiving it.




19:22

DJ (SleeplessByte)

📜 It would automatically do a first review, removing the stress from one of the maintainers to have to say "this is wrong".




19:23

DJ (SleeplessByte)

Yep, @Corey, I agree with that. 




19:23

Bobby Towers (porkostomus)

oh cool




19:23

DJ (SleeplessByte)

📜 Erik is currently saying: please keep tagging me if you need me, for example if it's your first exercise.




19:24

DJ (SleeplessByte)

👋🏽 Taiyab is here




19:24

DJ (SleeplessByte)

📜 Erik is also suggesting to do an Early Draft PR -- it's easier to receive feedback there and definitely ask for help. We can also help with writing stories




19:25

Sascha

https://github.com/exercism/v3/tree/master/reference/stories




19:25

DJ (SleeplessByte)

📜 We also have a folder to write stories to which people can use, which Sacha just posted.




19:25

wolf99

An example of that is a recent x86 concept exercise PR




19:26

DJ (SleeplessByte)

📜 Jeremy is saying: One of the main frustrations is the difference in the level of feedback a PR requires. It's basically difficult to get the right balance between nitpicking and global feedback.




19:26

Erik (ErikSchierboom)

@wolf99 Yes, that was a brilliant example!




19:26

https://github.com/exercism/v3/pull/1356




19:27

DJ (SleeplessByte)

📜 Erik is re-enforcing that we have an example where this draft-first process worked really well.




19:28

DJ (SleeplessByte)

📜  Jeremy is proposing to standardise a draft-first approach across the v3 repo. We would suggest to PR instructions.md (story exists, it's not offensive) and a sample "implementation".




19:29

DJ (SleeplessByte)

📜 This will enable us to give feedback on the story/is-this-a-good-concept-exercise phase and then on the nitty-picky stuff later.

19:35

Sascha

Hi Scott 👋




19:35

DJ (SleeplessByte)

I think a new contributor for JS is now building on top of the arrays (card magician) exercise (which is basically a remodel of the research exercise I did) and using that for two more exercises.




19:35

Scott Paul Jones

Sorry I'm late!

Is help wanted on that issue?




19:42

KOTP

The experiment continues.




19:43

Erik (ErikSchierboom)

@wolf99 It would be interesting to check if you think the current documentation solves many of those points in the issue




19:43

(I know I've linked it before)




19:43

wolf99

@Erik +1




19:43

Erik (ErikSchierboom)

Although the indirect way to go about that would be to build an exercise and note what you think is unclear




19:43

Erik (ErikSchierboom)

:)




19:44

DJ (SleeplessByte)

If you want to play with the JavaScript v3 Exercises in a similar "system": http://exercism-playground.derk-jan.com/




19:45

DJ (SleeplessByte)

(for context, Jeremy and I have talked about how much I hated it for hours and hours)




19:50

Sascha

"Feature" request: It would be nice to have a brief, regular (maybe fortnightly?) update/changelog for doc changes etc. Sometimes there are changes to the docs, or directory structures and it's hard to notice when you've been involved in v3 for some time. The commit log has all the info but it's not curated at all.




19:51

Sascha

sure




19:52

DJ (SleeplessByte)

GET ALL THE REPUTATION




19:52

Me

So basically turning mentoring into a game??




19:53

Sascha

:P




19:53

Erik (ErikSchierboom)

@Job Well, sort of. But mostly to reward people




19:54

Me

so... basically an rpg

nah nvm just mmo




19:55

DJ (SleeplessByte)

Obviously I get all the credits. That seems fair to me.




19:55

Erik (ErikSchierboom)

RPGs _were_ an inspiration for v2 BTW. Progressing and unlocking things.

RPG = Real Programming Game?

19:56

Erik (ErikSchierboom)

:D




19:56

wolf99

Sorry: off topic from the question at hand: Does credits to obtain mentoring mean that people that are already good at some programming languages will essentially get preferential treatment in other tracks? If so this could leave people that are newer to programming, are struggle more, always having slower mentor feedback because they have less credits and less chance to build credits?




19:56

Sascha

Do it the other way around: code golf scoring




19:58

DJ (SleeplessByte)

(which I have)




19:58

Me

We do want to avoid mentors from focussing on the "most rewarding" language 




19:58

Erik (ErikSchierboom)

@wolf99 The idea is that newer people would receive a steady, fixed amount of credits, so they would be able to also receive the mentoring benefits. This is the thing we need to be careful about




20:00

Erik (ErikSchierboom)

We're definitely aware of possible issues of fairness and rest assured, being inclusive and fair is one of Exercism's core tenets




20:00

wolf99

:)




20:00

zuzia-kru

I think it could be a great push for beginners if there's a way to show them that you don't have to know everything to help someone else...having said that I wouldn't know how to achieve that exactly




20:01

Erik (ErikSchierboom)

Yes! That is absolutely one of the things we want to encourage. Excellent point 




20:04

DJ (SleeplessByte)

⌛ 5 past the hour, but we don't need to 🏃🏽‍♂️




20:09

Corey (cmccandless)

Could we work out a way for individuals to put up their own credits as a bounty for certain GitHub issues?




20:09

Noah Betzen

Do we need to ask some economists for how to implement an Exercism economy?




20:09

DJ (SleeplessByte)

We need a sink




20:09

KOTP

Mentoring that student and encouraging them to mentor others is a positive sum transaction though.




20:09

Sascha

Bring in a game designer, not an economist :D 




20:10

Me

I mean my mom is an economist




20:10

Sascha

MMO economies have the same issues




20:10

wolf99

We'll end up with a "Jon Skeet" rep billionaire of Exercism :D




20:10

Me

I'll talk to her\




20:10

Nic {'.'}

Let's get a guest Economist on the next call. :)




20:10

Me

hahaha, I'll try to get my mom on the next call




20:11

Erik (ErikSchierboom)

20:11

DJ (SleeplessByte)

1. tie it to real world money
2. add a cap
3. have a real sink (like time)




20:11

Me

and no... I'm not "mommy's special little boy"




20:11

Me

XD




20:12

DJ (SleeplessByte)

(this is why there is a max of 500 (?) on SO)




20:12

Erik (ErikSchierboom)

Yep, I was just about to mention that




20:12

Erik (ErikSchierboom)

They have the same issues and years of experience




20:12

Erik (ErikSchierboom)

They=StackOverflow




20:12

Me

okay, I will try to copy the chat and format it into a .md file and put it on slack so people can look at the chat too




20:13

Noah Betzen

Credits could have a decay rate (aka a "sink" in the form of time).




20:13

Bye for now.

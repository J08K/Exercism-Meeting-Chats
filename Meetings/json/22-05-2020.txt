Hiya!




19:01

Sascha

it's closer to normal here again :) 




19:03

Sascha

I thought that too but the number of new infections is going down again. Mostly some very local breakouts




19:04

Me

Not like Netherlands really had a mandatory lockdown anyway




19:04

Tim (@neenjaw)

5-10 days from super-spreader events is when things pick up.




19:05

Sascha

Is it connected to your home wifi?




19:05

Sascha

Let's hack Exercism through your mug




19:06

Sascha

brb

Tim (@neenjaw)

This chat will be link-less




19:10

Tim (@neenjaw)

I will try, big shoes to fill

Tim (@neenjaw)

Elixir is 18, though some generated by `mix`




19:10

Erik (@erikschierboom)

Those don't count :P




19:11

Tim (@neenjaw)

Just going to line additions count, gotta keep my #6 contributor status :P

19:13

Erik (@erikschierboom)

Example: https://github.com/exercism/v3/pull/1497 I've left some comments, but it is definitely good enough to merge




19:15

Tim (@neenjaw)

https://github.com/exercism/v3/pull/1489 <-- an example of the 3 file initial PR




19:15

Erik (@erikschierboom)

https://github.com/exercism/v3/pull/1486 <- another example




19:18

Erik (@erikschierboom)

@Sascha TODO's!




19:18

Sascha

🎉🎉🎉🎉

19:22

Erik (@erikschierboom)

Example of improve issue: https://github.com/exercism/v3/issues/1300




19:24

Tim (@neenjaw)

I have spent more time this week making detailed action points in issues and then almost immediately got a new maintainer to sign on




19:24

BethanyG

WOOT!




19:25

Taiyab Raja

Awesoem




19:25

Taiyab Raja

Awesome*




19:25

Erik (@erikschierboom)

Shoutout to Angelika!




19:25

Me

I dont think we've had 'that' much progress on the Python track, but I'm currently working on one, I am not sure where other contributors are with their exercises.




19:26

Tim (@neenjaw)

It has been quite revitalizing to have a fresh set of eyes actively contributing PRs




19:26

Erik (@erikschierboom)

@Job is there someone sort of "in the lead" for the Python track? Someone that keeps track of progress?




19:27

Me

@Erik Yawpitch was an active contributer deffinetly, so we need to try and fill his shoes




19:28

Erik (@erikschierboom)

I have full confidence I you all :)




19:29

Me

Thanks, I think we'll be alright with the amount of contributors we have




19:29

Erik (@erikschierboom)

Let me know if I can help




19:29

BethanyG

@job - at the bottom of this page, there is a tracking table.  https://github.com/exercism/v3/tree/master/languages/python/reference  Not perfect, but we are trying to keep track




19:29

Me

(Although I'm not sure how many of thos contributors are very active)




19:30

BethanyG

There is also a to-do list here:  https://github.com/exercism/v3/projects/13#card-35710681




19:30

Erik (@erikschierboom)

@Bethany That looks very useful!




19:30

BethanyG

very open to suggestions to improve both the table and the to-dos.  :-)




19:31

Me

@Bethany, is there some way to add who is actively working on it?




19:31

Me

Looks great though




19:31

Jeremy Walker (iHiD)

19:32

BethanyG

oooh.  Shiny. 




19:32

Erik (@erikschierboom)

@Sascha FTW! And also DJ




19:32

Sascha

DJ designed most of it :) 




19:33

Tim (@neenjaw)

Ooooooooooh, this is great!




19:33

Taiyab Raja

DJ and Sascha making moves :D




19:33

Erik (@erikschierboom)

https://github.com/exercism/v3/pull/1499




19:34

Sascha

it's commented out




19:34

Erik (@erikschierboom)

Is it a TODO? ;)




19:34

Jeremy Walker (iHiD)

https://gist.github.com/SaschaMann/7195698acc1732a953d05bcd4b69cbe9#file-news-md




19:34

Sascha

yes




19:35

Erik (@erikschierboom)

Brilliant




19:40

Tim (@neenjaw)

Agreed, the difficulty ratings are a frequent issue by well-meaning students on the elixir track




19:40

Me

I'm not sure if other tracks have done this, but should we just make a thread in Slack with a big list of what has to be done in that track, so we just remind people what they can do, because I think not a lot of people 'really' know what they can do with contributing. I can try to put one together for Python :)




19:40

Me

(Just to remind people)




19:40

Tim (@neenjaw)

https://github.com/exercism/elixir/issues/534




19:42

Erik (@erikschierboom)

@Job I don't know how other tracks do this. Having GitHub issues created (which you do for Python I believe) is a great start. I don't know if maybe have a sticky message with links to e.g. those issues (or even better, a search that lists all those issues) would be nice




19:42

Taiyab Raja

@Job Something that posts in the Slack every week or something would be cool. Maybe on a Friday evening.




19:43

Me

@Erik, yes that's I think a good idea




19:43

BethanyG

@job - posting status into Slack from GitHub might be good, but I worry about keeping them in sync, so a Github-centered solution would be good.




19:43

Me

@Taiyab Yes something like that




19:44

Sascha

It looks like a button they want you to press due to the design 




19:44

Tim (@neenjaw)

It risks devolving to StackOverflow




19:44

Sascha

https://github.com/exercism/v3/discussions/159 (just for testing)




19:45

Me

@Bethany, so we can make like the 'news' page that Sascha made, and we'll put a link with a summary in the Slack channel every week




19:45

Sascha

Right now it feels like Q&A rather than discussions




19:53

Sascha

@Job: It would be fairly straightforward to generate track-specific NEWS in addition to it. 




19:54

Me

@Sascha Yes, great idea, I'll work on it. What does @BethanyG think of it? 




19:56

BethanyG

Sure - but let's discuss via slack after this.  Just so we are on the same page as to what we'd pull, and how we are currently tracking, etc. etc.  Having a hard time multitasking atm.  :-) 




19:58

Me

@BethanyG Yeah, let's take our time with working on stuff like this, especially with all this "quarintine" going on. School is also giving me lots and lots of homework and Im trying to combine that with Exercism and learning C# too XD




19:59

Me

So no pressure on this 'NEWS' thing




20:00

Sascha

⌛




20:01

Me

@Bethany, I'll put up a thread in Slack to tell people what it would be like and ask them for feedback and if they want it

that works well indeed

Are we going to finalize the English version we use... you know that other version of English that the American's dong speak.  Yep, that's right Australian English.

Okay, good luck!




19:10

Tim (@neenjaw)

:wave: catch you later




19:10

DJ (SleeplessByte)

We'll probably want to see the test runner result in the "admin" panel where we write the representation.




19:10

Erik (@erikschierboom)

Good luck with your work!




19:13

DJ (SleeplessByte)

I also just want to avail my services to bounce your exercise idea on -- been working well with Erik :D




19:13

Erik (@erikschierboom)

Yep! DJ was a great help

https://github.com/exercism/v3/issues/1418 is the proposal issue right?

19:16

Tim (@neenjaw)

Do students only see a single file in the editor? I see that the method overload exercise has multiple classes in one folder, is that normal for csharp or an adaptation?




19:16

Tim (@neenjaw)

*one file




19:16

Erik (@erikschierboom)

There are two classes: an implementation and a test file. So students will only work on one file




19:17

Erik (@erikschierboom)

The third file is a project file




19:17

Tim (@neenjaw)

ok, so just concat the classes/modules into one file for edit




19:17

Erik (@erikschierboom)

I think there are languages that will require multiple files. C with implementation and header files come to mind




19:19

Tim (@neenjaw)

elixir can get by with putting modules all into one file, it just isn't normal in the greater ecosystem




19:20

Erik (@erikschierboom)

Yeah. C# has the same. You can have multiple classes in a file, but it is less common




19:20

DJ (SleeplessByte)

Just ban Java, Kotlin only.




19:21

Corey (cmccandless)

I have to drop off. Bye everyone!

I like how Java is evolving.  Java 5 in uni though.... X_x

If they don't show up on the track maintenance dashboard, the config doesn't have them




19:29

DJ (SleeplessByte)

you can use that as sanity check

*in flight




19:35

Erik (@erikschierboom)

@eli We do have to decide what to do there. GH Actions are nice, but there are a lot of edge cases




19:35

efx (Eli Flanagan)

Ah, yes, I agree. This is mostly because it is a fork right?




19:36

Erik (@erikschierboom)

Actually, I think it is mostly because GH Actions cannot trigger other GH Actions when the default token is used. Sascha suggested using a custom SSH key, which would have the right permissions




19:36

Sascha

@efx: Push an empty commit `commit -m "Trigger CI" --allow-empty` to trigger them in the meanwhile




19:37

Me

Yawpitch and me have been "working" on a concept exercise together. I am going to start to work on the files this week, I couldn't work on it this week because of computer problems. After this, I'll try to pick up the pace and make more exercises.




19:37

efx (Eli Flanagan)

Thanks! how could I do that on a fork though?




19:37

DJ (SleeplessByte)

@Eli, you can't unless you have rights on that fork.




19:38

Sascha

If the submitter has not unchecked the "allow maintainers to push changes" box, you can push to it 




19:38

DJ (SleeplessByte)

It's a flag they can set when creating a PR




19:38

DJ (SleeplessByte)

yeh




19:38

DJ (SleeplessByte)

that




19:38

Me

Most of the Python exercises are in the discussing phase...




19:38

efx (Eli Flanagan)

got it. Thanks Sascha. I will try after the call.




19:39

Tim (@neenjaw)

Ya, python's work on the pre-build stage is impressive.




19:39

Sascha

closing/reclosing may also work, not sure though




19:40

Sascha

I think having those "Hackdays" or w(e you called them could help to actually get people talk√∂ing and then collaborating




19:40

Sascha

(the gotomeet chat is laggy af when typing. 3 words appear at once x_x)




19:40

Sidebar: What is Lief's poster? firefly?




19:42

Erik (@erikschierboom)

@Job That's great. It is basically discussing everything upfront instead of in a PR 




19:42

DJ (SleeplessByte)

You mean "Best scifi ever"




19:42

Leif Swenson

@neenjaw you guessed it xD

Agreed! https://media.giphy.com/media/UvwI1X7XkbXq0/200.gif




19:43

Tim (@neenjaw)

Oh, I 10000% agree.  It's a modern-day tragedy that it didn't catch on.




19:43

BethanyG

@job ..I think that's a great one...BUT ... we need about 10 more of those ... so that we get them on the way to fleshed-out.




19:44

I'll do my best to do more and more :))

Exception filters.

It's looking like a fortnite farm, not a minecraft farm @neenjaw




19:58

Me

[Off-topic] How much of a priority is it to have a visual (chat) overlay for the meeting videos for youtube? Because I am first gonna focus on getting some exercises done and after that I'll try to get some more progress on the chats overlay.




19:58

Tim (@neenjaw)

It's the new minecraft launcher




19:58

Tim (@neenjaw)

:)




19:58

Me

Oh yes haha




19:59

Me

The hard part about the visual overlay for the chats is because there is no timecode in the video, so syncing the chat with the video would be hard




19:59

Sascha

probably not even necessary if you can convince Jeremy to add them while editing :P 




20:00

Sascha

as long as you have the overlay clips/frames




20:00

Me

Haha yes, but Jeremy should have some free time too




20:00

Erik (@erikschierboom)

I'd take Concept Exercises over a Chat Overlay anytime :)




20:00

Sascha

^




20:00

Sascha

or have a syncing point in the video itself




20:01

Sascha

like someonie shows a clock in the pre-recording thing (that was 10 words at once, great chatting experience lol)




20:01

Me

Yeah... but there is no actual time code in the chat itself either




20:01

Sascha

:|




20:01

Sascha

maybe its not possible then 




20:01

Me

No no no never say that




20:01

Sascha

without toio much effort




20:02

Me

I can probably create a program to look at the chat in realtime, copy it, and inject timecode




20:02

Tim (@neenjaw)

And mentoring is very discrete, it's easy to bite off a small chunk and succeed




20:02

Me

but... I'll first get some exercises done and then focus on the meetings




20:02

Erik (@erikschierboom)

Sweet!

yupp




20:05

I think bullet points just don't help me to understand the scope/weight of concepts




20:05

Interesting! Two schools of thought :)

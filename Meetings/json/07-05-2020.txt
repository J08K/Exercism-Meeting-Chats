Idea: All feedback beyond the "good enough" poing should be accompanied by a GH issue to fix it later.

Cost of criticism.  Makes you think about is it the fight worth fighting.

Indeed

Just controlling the "flow"




19:54

Sascha

No thanks

I wonder if since you need to spend credits to be mentored you can run out of credits. So did you think about where this line will be when you won't be able to continue learning from mentors without earning credits somehow? 




19:54

efx (Eli Flanagan)

haha




19:55

Me

@zuzia-kru You've got a point




19:55

DJ (SleeplessByte)

Yeah it's what I mentioned last week




19:55

Erik (ErikSchierboom)

@zuzia-kru The idea is that you'd always get some basic number of daily/weekly credits or something of the like




19:56

zuzia-kru

ahh right, I think I remember now from last week, thanks!




19:57

Taiyab Raja

If you run out of credits, you might have to take out a loan :D

Could we quickly recap a little on courses with less students (thus mentors will likely get less credits) and if they will get the same amount of credits as a mentor from a different, more popular track? We talked about it last week, but what will we do about mentors "farming" on a high-earning track?




19:59

DJ (SleeplessByte)

(same btw, if it wasn't clear)

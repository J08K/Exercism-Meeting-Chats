**J08K (Job van der Wal)**

Indeed

_19:52_

**J08K (Job van der Wal)**

Just controlling the "flow"

---
_19:54_

**Sascha**

No thanks

---
_19:54_

**zuzia-kru**

I wonder if since you need to spend credits to be mentored you can run out of credits. So did you think about where this line will be when you won't be able to continue learning from mentors without earning credits somehow? 

---
_19:54_

**efx (Eli Flanagan)**

haha

---
_19:55_

**J08K (Job van der Wal)**

@zuzia-kru You've got a point

---
_19:55_

**DJ (SleeplessByte)**

Yeah it's what I mentioned last week

---
_19:55_

**Erik (ErikSchierboom)**

@zuzia-kru The idea is that you'd always get some basic number of daily/weekly credits or something of the like

---
_19:56_

**zuzia-kru**

ahh right, I think I remember now from last week, thanks!

---
_19:57_

**Taiyab Raja**

If you run out of credits, you might have to take out a loan :D

---
_19:57_

**efx (Eli Flanagan)**

i'm starting Exercism Banke right after the call

**J08K (Job van der Wal)**

Could we quickly recap a little on courses with less students (thus mentors will likely get less credits) and if they will get the same amount of credits as a mentor from a different, more popular track? We talked about it last week, but what will we do about mentors "farming" on a high-earning track?

---
_19:59_

**DJ (SleeplessByte)**

(same btw, if it wasn't clear)

---
_19:59_

**DJ (SleeplessByte)**

(as in, agree with brooks)

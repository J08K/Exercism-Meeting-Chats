Btw, is there a way to stop the grid from jumping around whenever someone joins/parts? it's a bit confusing everytime it happens

I teach remotely via webcam for my day job. Students not turning on their webcams is definitely unnerving.

A**T**

_19:04_


Is it considered more polite to turn on the camera even if I intend to just lurk? I'm not sure how this software handles so many video feeds.

**D**

_19:04_


IMA be sorta inactive but definitely just ping if someone needs anything from me

Does it use GH's noreply email or the exercism account email for the commit?

E**S**

_19:18_

E**S**


The Exercism account user/email

M**S**

_19:18_


that's why you sign your commits!

**S**

_19:19_


@Erik: Should add a warning about that on the site, since it exposes your email publicly forever in the git history

E**S**

_19:19_

E**S**


Right. Good addition. https://github.com/exercism/v3-dashboard/issues for issues ;)

**S**

_19:20_


Will the opposite also hold true, i.e. can one ignore the v3 site and just use GH directly?

E**S**

_19:20_

E**S**


Absolutely

All my exercises with their status.

For maintainers: Links to exercises that already exist for that track; and DJ's conncept grapher when he is able to complete it

I took inspiration from tehshpinx and updated the C# list of concepts with links to exercises: https://github.com/exercism/v3/blob/master/languages/csharp/reference/README.md#concepts Could also be useful

We do, but we had discussions whether things were optional :)

Yes we have optional for yes or no, but not for changing

@DJ: no, it allows keys too, it's not a boolean

**D**

_19:53_


No. It allows you to say it's optional based on this property

**D**

_19:53_


Or whatevs :p

**D**

_19:53_


It doesn't allow you to inverse the test or something like that haha

**S**

_19:53_


ah okay

T**R**

_19:54_


Let's all hate Jeremy together!

**S**

_19:54_


what about the idea of "exercise owners" that you mentioned you and Erik discussed before?

**D**

_19:56_


Ah yes

**S**

_19:57_


It's never obviously in or out of scope

**D**

_19:57_


Obviously

**R**

_19:58_


Would it be easier to have a permanently open issue for each exercise in each track and the "owner" is assigned to it? Any user issues raised about it can be mentioned/linked to in the thread so they can action it. And reassignment in case of drop out (or incompetence) can be done easily.

Erik the (benevolent) dictator?

Gotta add him to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life

Yes

E**S**

E**S**


Yes! üï∂

I think the biggest issue for me is that the problem spec keeps dictating the exercise instead of be a building block.

**S**

_20:08_


‚òù

M**S**

_20:09_


I look to problem spec as the *basis* for my track - i need to still translate to the proper idiom for my language

**D**

_20:10_


Yep..that's great!

That's not how those discussions go. But that's how it should be!

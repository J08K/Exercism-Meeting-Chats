Interwebs* @ Vic

---

## _19:45:_ **KOTP (Vic)**

Concentrated learning is good, but long term high intensivity while learning just doesn't seem intuitive.

---

## _19:46:_ **Tim (neenjaw)**

Never used teams

## _19:46:_ **Derek-J (OfficeByte)**

someone echos

## _19:48:_ **Jeremy Walker (iHiD)**

Zuzanna: https://teams.exercism.io - It's *very* rudamental

---

## _19:48:_ **Derek-J (OfficeByte)**

(just need to be able to delete things, and have tracks haha, not "exercises")

---

## _19:48:_ **Zuzanna Kru**

yeah, I just looked for it on the main page to make sure I understand what you're talking about :P

---

## _19:50:_ **KOTP (Vic)**

I had to do the same thing, basically guide based on original "track" and do so in teams, where other students can see and feedback.

---

## _19:52:_ **KOTP (Vic)**

In a group "classroom" thing, that was key was being abe to get to the solutions even while being worked on.

---

## _19:52:_ **Derek-J (OfficeByte)**

Yeah, so my recomm: don't merge them

---

## _19:52:_ **Derek-J (OfficeByte)**

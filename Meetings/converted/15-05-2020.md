---
_19:01_

**Sascha**

that works well indeed

---
_19:01_

**KOTP**

Are we going to finalize the English version we use... you know that other version of English that the American's dong speak.  Yep, that's right Australian English.

---
_19:01_

---
_19:02_

**Tim (@neenjaw)**

just uppers, no downers :P

---
_19:02_

**efx (Eli Flanagan)**

bookmarked Sascha :)

---
_19:07_

**DJ (SleeplessByte)**

Sorry for eating on the call -- we're getting our corona-hair cut right after the call üôàü§óü§óü§óü§óü§óü§ó

---
_19:08_

**J08K (Job van der Wal)**

Eetsmakelijk!

---
_19:08_

**DJ (SleeplessByte)**

‚ö† new limitations. FILE names must be be [A-Za-z0-9

---
_19:08_

**DJ (SleeplessByte)**

_-.]

---
_19:10_

**Scott Paul Jones**

Darn, work meeting conflict

---
_19:10_

**efx (Eli Flanagan)**

alas! :wave:

---
_19:10_

**Scott Paul Jones**

I'll try to catch up with the recording later

---
_19:10_

**J08K (Job van der Wal)**

Okay, good luck!

---
_19:10_

**Tim (@neenjaw)**

:wave: catch you later

---
_19:10_

**DJ (SleeplessByte)**

We'll probably want to see the test runner result in the "admin" panel where we write the representation.

---
_19:10_

**Erik (@erikschierboom)**

Good luck with your work!

---
_19:13_

**DJ (SleeplessByte)**

I also just want to avail my services to bounce your exercise idea on -- been working well with Erik :D

---
_19:13_

**Erik (@erikschierboom)**

Yep! DJ was a great help

---
_19:14_

**DJ (SleeplessByte)**

(Basically I will complain and then you make it even better)

---
_19:14_

**Erik (@erikschierboom)**

https://github.com/exercism/research_experiment_1/blob/master/exercises/csharp-1-a/.meta/config.json

---
_19:15_

**Erik (@erikschierboom)**

That's an example. Manually "crafted" :)

---
_19:15_

**efx (Eli Flanagan)**

https://github.com/exercism/v3/issues/1418 is the proposal issue right?

---
_19:15_

**Erik (@erikschierboom)**

https://github.com/exercism/v3/issues/1418#issuecomment-627251335

---
_19:16_

**Tim (@neenjaw)**

Do students only see a single file in the editor? I see that the method overload exercise has multiple classes in one folder, is that normal for csharp or an adaptation?

---
_19:16_

**Tim (@neenjaw)**

*one file

---
_19:16_

**Erik (@erikschierboom)**

There are two classes: an implementation and a test file. So students will only work on one file

---
_19:17_

**Erik (@erikschierboom)**

The third file is a project file

---
_19:17_

**Tim (@neenjaw)**

ok, so just concat the classes/modules into one file for edit

---
_19:17_

**Erik (@erikschierboom)**

I think there are languages that will require multiple files. C with implementation and header files come to mind

---
_19:19_

**Tim (@neenjaw)**

elixir can get by with putting modules all into one file, it just isn't normal in the greater ecosystem

---
_19:20_

**Erik (@erikschierboom)**

Yeah. C# has the same. You can have multiple classes in a file, but it is less common

---
_19:20_

**DJ (SleeplessByte)**

Just ban Java, Kotlin only.

---
_19:21_

**Corey (cmccandless)**

I have to drop off. Bye everyone!

---
_19:21_

**Erik (@erikschierboom)**

Bye!

---
_19:21_

**efx (Eli Flanagan)**

see ya!

---
_19:22_

**BethanyG**

bye!

---
_19:22_

**Tim (@neenjaw)**

I like how Java is evolving.  Java 5 in uni though.... X_x

---
_19:22_

**Erik (@erikschierboom)**

Checked exceptions :(

---
_19:23_

**Sascha**

try matlab if you dislike java. 1 function per file üò´

---
_19:23_

**Erik (@erikschierboom)**

:O

---
_19:25_

**efx (Eli Flanagan)**

trolled by Git. Again.

---
_19:29_

**Erik (@erikschierboom)**

- csharp: 14

---
_19:29_

**DJ (SleeplessByte)**

If they don't show up on the track maintenance dashboard, the config doesn't have them

---
_19:29_

**DJ (SleeplessByte)**

you can use that as sanity check

---
_19:30_

**efx (Eli Flanagan)**

(one if flight  for Rust too; somewhat blocked by https://github.com/exercism/v3/pull/1435)

---
_19:30_

**DJ (SleeplessByte)**

https://tracks.exercism.io/

---
_19:30_

**efx (Eli Flanagan)**

*in flight

---
_19:35_

**Erik (@erikschierboom)**

@eli We do have to decide what to do there. GH Actions are nice, but there are a lot of edge cases

---
_19:35_

**efx (Eli Flanagan)**

Ah, yes, I agree. This is mostly because it is a fork right?

---
_19:36_

**Erik (@erikschierboom)**

Actually, I think it is mostly because GH Actions cannot trigger other GH Actions when the default token is used. Sascha suggested using a custom SSH key, which would have the right permissions

---
_19:36_

**Sascha**

@efx: Push an empty commit `commit -m "Trigger CI" --allow-empty` to trigger them in the meanwhile

---
_19:37_

**J08K (Job van der Wal)**

Yawpitch and me have been "working" on a concept exercise together. I am going to start to work on the files this week, I couldn't work on it this week because of computer problems. After this, I'll try to pick up the pace and make more exercises.

---
_19:37_

**efx (Eli Flanagan)**

Thanks! how could I do that on a fork though?

---
_19:37_

**DJ (SleeplessByte)**

@Eli, you can't unless you have rights on that fork.

---
_19:38_

**Sascha**

If the submitter has not unchecked the "allow maintainers to push changes" box, you can push to it 

---
_19:38_

**DJ (SleeplessByte)**

It's a flag they can set when creating a PR

---
_19:38_

**DJ (SleeplessByte)**

yeh

---
_19:38_

**DJ (SleeplessByte)**

that

---
_19:38_

**J08K (Job van der Wal)**

Most of the Python exercises are in the discussing phase...

---
_19:38_

**efx (Eli Flanagan)**

got it. Thanks Sascha. I will try after the call.

---
_19:39_

**Tim (@neenjaw)**

Ya, python's work on the pre-build stage is impressive.

---
_19:39_

**Sascha**

closing/reclosing may also work, not sure though

---
_19:40_

**Sascha**

I think having those "Hackdays" or w(e you called them could help to actually get people talk√∂ing and then collaborating

---
_19:40_

**Sascha**

(the gotomeet chat is laggy af when typing. 3 words appear at once x_x)

---
_19:40_

**Erik (@erikschierboom)**

:D

---
_19:41_

**J08K (Job van der Wal)**

Most of python exercises are like this: https://github.com/exercism/v3/issues/877 This is the issue with Yawpitch and me.

---
_19:42_

**Tim (@neenjaw)**

Sidebar: What is Lief's poster? firefly?

---
_19:42_

**Erik (@erikschierboom)**

@Job That's great. It is basically discussing everything upfront instead of in a PR 

---
_19:42_

**DJ (SleeplessByte)**

You mean "Best scifi ever"

---
_19:42_

**Leif Swenson**

@neenjaw you guessed it xD

---
_19:43_

**Erik (@erikschierboom)**

Agreed! https://media.giphy.com/media/UvwI1X7XkbXq0/200.gif

---
_19:43_

**Tim (@neenjaw)**

Oh, I 10000% agree.  It's a modern-day tragedy that it didn't catch on.

---
_19:43_

**BethanyG**

@job ..I think that's a great one...BUT ... we need about 10 more of those ... so that we get them on the way to fleshed-out.

---
_19:44_

**J08K (Job van der Wal)**

I'll do my best to do more and more :))

---
_19:45_

**BethanyG**

nitpicks should all contain a ```suggestion so that you can just go through and click them all ¬¥

**Erik (@erikschierboom)**

Know what exceptions are.

---
_19:57_

**Erik (@erikschierboom)**

Exception filters.

---
_19:58_

**Leif Swenson**

It's looking like a fortnite farm, not a minecraft farm @neenjaw

---
_19:58_

**J08K (Job van der Wal)**

[Off-topic] How much of a priority is it to have a visual (chat) overlay for the meeting videos for youtube? Because I am first gonna focus on getting some exercises done and after that I'll try to get some more progress on the chats overlay.

---
_19:58_

**Tim (@neenjaw)**

It's the new minecraft launcher

---
_19:58_

**Tim (@neenjaw)**

:)

---
_19:58_

**J08K (Job van der Wal)**

Oh yes haha

---
_19:59_

**J08K (Job van der Wal)**

The hard part about the visual overlay for the chats is because there is no timecode in the video, so syncing the chat with the video would be hard

---
_19:59_

**Sascha**

probably not even necessary if you can convince Jeremy to add them while editing :P 

---
_20:00_

**Sascha**

as long as you have the overlay clips/frames

---
_20:00_

**J08K (Job van der Wal)**

Haha yes, but Jeremy should have some free time too

---
_20:00_

**Erik (@erikschierboom)**

I'd take Concept Exercises over a Chat Overlay anytime :)

---
_20:00_

**Sascha**

^

---
_20:00_

**Sascha**

or have a syncing point in the video itself

---
_20:01_

**Sascha**

like someonie shows a clock in the pre-recording thing (that was 10 words at once, great chatting experience lol)

---
_20:01_

**J08K (Job van der Wal)**

Yeah... but there is no actual time code in the chat itself either

---
_20:01_

**Sascha**

:|

---
_20:01_

**Sascha**

maybe its not possible then 

---
_20:01_

**J08K (Job van der Wal)**

No no no never say that

---
_20:01_

**Sascha**

without toio much effort

---
_20:02_

**J08K (Job van der Wal)**

I can probably create a program to look at the chat in realtime, copy it, and inject timecode

---
_20:02_

**Tim (@neenjaw)**

And mentoring is very discrete, it's easy to bite off a small chunk and succeed

---
_20:02_

**J08K (Job van der Wal)**

but... I'll first get some exercises done and then focus on the meetings

---
_20:02_

**Erik (@erikschierboom)**

Sweet!

---
_20:04_

**Sascha**

ü§î

---
_20:04_

**Sascha**

Same, Erik.

---
_20:05_

**efx (Eli Flanagan)**

+1 on the intro taking longer.

---
_20:05_

**J08K (Job van der Wal)**

yupp

---
_20:05_

**Tim (@neenjaw)**

I think bullet points just don't help me to understand the scope/weight of concepts

---
_20:05_

**Erik (@erikschierboom)**

Interesting! Two schools of thought :)

---
_20:06_

**efx (Eli Flanagan)**

‚åõ‚åõ‚åõ

---
_20:06_

**J08K (Job van der Wal)**

Atleast it helps us think :/

---
_20:09_

**Tim (@neenjaw)**
